Simple POS that alow the user to add/delete Items, create an invoice and print it and also display the sales history.
I've created this application for a friend of mine, so It's not intended to be a professional application and it's far from being a complete solution. more complete solutions can be found on the web.

# Framework
this application was made with wpf using visual studio 2015

# Database
The Database is embded using Sql Server Compact and data is stored in the Data.sdf file in the Ui folder

# printing
Invoice printing is designed for 80 mm width thermal printers
Sales report printing is designed for A4 printers

# trying the application
when launching the app it will ask for a username and a password. you can login using the username/password admin/admin or simple/simple.
